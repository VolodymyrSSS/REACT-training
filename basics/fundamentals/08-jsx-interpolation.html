  <h2>Understand and Use Interpolation in JSX</h2>

  <p>
    Here we learn that interpolation is not unique to JSX and weâ€™ll learn the
    limitations and capabilities of interpolation in JSX.
  </p>

  <p>
    This type of interpolation is not unique to just JSX. In fact, we have a
    couple other examples of interpolation right here. This file is an HTML
    file, and we start with HTML all right here. We're still going through HTML
    until we hit the end of this opening script tag. Now we're in JavaScript
    land. We also have style tags, and now we're in CSS land. HTML has always
    had this type of interpolation.

  <script type="text/babel">
    function CharacterCount({ text }) {
      return (
        <div>
          {`The text "${text}" has `}
          {text.length ? <strong>{text.length}</strong> : 'No'}
          {' characters'}
        </div>
      );
    }

    const element = (
      <>
        <CharacterCount text="Hello World" />
        <CharacterCount text="" />
      </>
    );

    ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));

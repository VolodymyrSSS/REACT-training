  <h2>Create a User Interface with React’s JSX syntax</h2>

  <div id="root"></div>

  <p>
    It’s awesome that we can interact directly with React’s createElement API to
    create React elements and then hand those off to React DOM to get them to
    show up on the screen. But it’s not the most ergonomic API to write our UI
    code in. It’s hard to track when one element starts and the next one ends.
    This is why the React team came up with JSX. It’s an extension to the
    JavaScript language to support syntax that looks similar to the HTML that
    you would write to create these DOM elements (there are a handful of
    differences). JSX gives us an expressive syntax for representing our UI,
    without losing the benefits and powers of writing our UI in JavaScript.

  <p>
    Babel is a JavaScript compiler supporting the next generation of JavaScript
    as well as non-standard features like JSX. If we go to this Try It Out page
    and then go over here and copy our code and paste it in here, then we'll see
    that our code is being compiled to something that's very familiar to us.

  <p>
    we wanted to do here was make it so that we can author our UI without using
    the React createElement API and instead use JSX, which is an HTML-like
    syntax for authoring UI. [2:44] To do this, we need a compiler like Babel.
    We installed Babel standalone, which will compile our code on the fly in the
    browser. We also had to update our type to text/babel. Babel will look for
    all scripts that have that type, compile the code that's inside them, and
    insert a new script that has the compiled code so the browser can evaluate
    it. [3:05] In a typical application, you will not be using Babel standalone.
    Instead, you'll be using another tool which probably is using Babel to
    compile your code. That way, you get a much more friendly syntax for
    authoring your UI with React.

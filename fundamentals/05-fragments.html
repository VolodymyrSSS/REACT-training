  <h2>Render two elements side-by-side with React Fragments</h2>

  <div id="root"></div>

  <p>In React, you canâ€™t render two React elements side-by-side (<span>Hello</span><span>World</span>). They have to be wrapped in another element (like a <div>). This may seem like an odd limitation, but when you think about the fact that JSX is compiled to React.createElement calls, it makes sense.</p>

    <p>The React fragment allows us to put elements side by side without having to have some sort of container element like a div. This can be useful when you're creating things like tables that have a specific structure to them. Our root element is this React fragment. We'll do an open bracket and say React.Fragment. We'll close that off with React.Fragment. Then we'll want to create a span for hello, so <span>Hello</span>. Then we'll do a space and then <span>World and close that off. If we save this, we're going to get the exact same output, and we're using our React.Fragment element.</p>

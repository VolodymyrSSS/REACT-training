  <h2>Create a Simple Reusable React Component</h2>

  <div id="root"></div>

  <p>
    One of the biggest paradigm shifts that React offered to the UI ecosystem
    was the component model. It allows you to package up all the logic, styling,
    and layout of a unit of UI into a box that you can easily move around and
    reuse without exposing any of the implementation details of the component.
    You don’t have to understand how a component works internally to use it
    effectively. With idiomatic component architecture, rendering a component in
    one place won’t impact other parts of your app. In this example is shown how
    to create a React component and how to use it.
  </p>

  <p>
    When you give a capital letter in JSX, that's the same as calling
    React.createElement with the function that you're referencing. That allows
    you to create a custom component that you can use to reuse code over and
    over again.

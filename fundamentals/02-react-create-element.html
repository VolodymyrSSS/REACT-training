  <h2>Create a User Interface with React’s createElement API</h2>

  <div id="root"></div>

  <p>
    React uses the same APIs to control and update the DOM as Document but it
    offers so much to the table that we’re going to introduce it into the
    project and rewrite what we’ve written to React code. Instead of creating
    DOM elements, we’ll create React elements and then hand those off to
    react-dom to handle turning those into DOM elements and putting them into
    the page. It’s important to understand the createElement API first so you
    understand the magic

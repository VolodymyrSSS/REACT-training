  <h2>Validate Custom React Component Props with PropTypes</h2>

  <div id="root"></div>

  <p>
    When you create reusable React components, you want to make sure that people
    use them correctly. The best way to do this is to use TypeScript in your
    codebase to give you compile-time checking of your code. But if youâ€™re not
    using TypeScript, you can still use PropTypes to get runtime validation.
  </p>

  <p>
    React supports a feature called prop-types that allows you to validate the
    types of props that are being passed to your components when they're
    rendered. We'll have a key for the prop that we want to validate. That's
    going to be a function that takes the prop name and the component name. We
    could add a bunch more validators to the prop-types, for numbers and
    whatever else you could imagine.
  </p>

  <p>
    But if you want to make sure that it's required, then you can add "a dot is
    required on both of these." Save that and now you'll get a warning saying
    that the first name is the wrong type and the last name is required but
    wasn't provided.
  </p>

  <p>
    One reasonable concern you might have about prop-types is that it adds a
    fair amount of code that needs to be run whenever React is rendering your
    components which may impact performance.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you want to take things a step further, then you can actually get a Babel
    plugin that will remove the prop-types from your source code for production.
    That plugin is called Babel-plugin-transform-remove-prop-types. You could
    install that and use that in your production build, or many tool kits
    install and use this by default. As well, you can go to the prop-types page
    on npm.

  <h2>Use JSX effectively with React</h2>

  <p>
    JSX is not an entirely different language, but it is a bit of an extension
    to the language, so knowing how you would express certain JavaScript things
    within the JSX syntax is important to using JSX effectively. In this example
    we’ll explore a few different things you can do with JSX, like
    interpolation, composition, and spreading props. And we’ll compare these
    syntaxes with what is generated by babel so we have a good understanding of
    how this translates to regular JavaScript calls into React.createElement.
  </p>

  <p>
    To interpolate we're going to use curly braces and put children in here.
    Anything you put between these two curly braces can be a JavaScript
    expression. Whatever that expression evaluates to is the value that gets
    placed into this position for the React.createElement call.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another thing we can do is if I make an object here where we have our props,
    we're going to make children and className part of those props. Then I can
    come right here, remove all of those, and I can say, "Hey, Babel, I want you
    to take all of these props and pass them to the React.createElement call
    that you create for this div." Interpolate onto this div's prop's position a
    spread of that prop's object. If we save that, we can take a look at the
    compiled version of this. We get our props object. We have
    React.createElement. Then it just passes the props directly. Then I can add
    additional props if I want to. Then Babel is going to extend the props that
    we provided with the props that we're spreading. We get a single combined
    object for the second argument of the React.createElement call. Because of
    the way that object.assign works, if we wanted to override one of the
    properties in this props object, then we could do so simply by providing it
    after we spread those props in the props position for this element.
